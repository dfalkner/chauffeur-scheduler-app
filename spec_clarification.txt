* We will be using AWS Cognito so we will not have passwords in our database.
. One Opportunity can be offered to many Chauffeurs, one at a time in priority order until one accepts, but an Opportunity may be accepted by only one Chauffeur.
. Let's create a relationship so that a Chauffeur belongs to one Organization and an Organization may have 0 or more Chauffers. This Chauffeur Organization is a subtype of Organizations.
. Dispatchers belong to an Organization that is a subtype of Organization.
. When an opportunity is offered to a Chauffeur it may, optionally, have a text field containing compensation terms to inform the Chauffeur of what they will earn.
. Each Chauffeur has 0 to many vehicles. Each vehicle belongs to one Chauffeur. The Vehicle information includes Make, Model, Color, Year, Number of Seats, License Plate, VIN,
 Condition (lookup standard condition lables), and a description. The description will be used by Chauffeur to promote the vehicle to dispatchers.
. Chauffuers may elect to be visible to Dispatchers in all Organizations.
. Chauffuers have a profile page that displays a photo, commercial driver's license number, contact information and a list of their vehicles.
. Organizations super-types have basic information like contact info, website.
. Chauffeur Organization subtypes will have business contacts, addresses, phone numbers, email address, tax id numbers. These are optional values for now.
. Instead of vehicle type we will have vehicles.
. Dispatchers will be able to filter and search by vehicle attributes such as number of seats, condition, make, model, and year
