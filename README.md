# chauffeur-scheduler-app

## Introduction
The Chauffeur-Scheduler-App is a dynamic web application designed to streamline the process of scheduling and managing chauffeur services. Targeting the specific needs of a chauffeur business, this application bridges the gap between schedulers who request services and the chauffeur business owner who coordinates and fulfills these requests.

## Features
Service Request Submission: Schedulers can easily submit detailed service requests, including guest information, dates, times, and locations.
Owner Response Functionality: The chauffeur, as the business owner, receives these requests and can promptly respond, accepting or declining the bookings.
Automated Notifications: Utilizing AWS Simple Email Service (SES), the app sends automated email notifications to facilitate clear and efficient communication.
User Authentication: Secure user authentication is managed through AWS Cognito, ensuring data security for both schedulers and the chauffeur.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers to cater to users on various devices.

## Technology Stack
Frontend: Flask, a Python micro web framework, for an intuitive user interface.
Backend: AWS Lambda for serverless backend operations, offering scalability and efficiency.
Database: Amazon RDS with PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and management.
Authentication: AWS Cognito for robust user authentication and security.
Notification Service: AWS Simple Email Service (SES) for seamless email communications.

## Setup and Installation
